1. Data is stored in stack or heap.

2.*** C++ has primitive data types.
The difference between them is how much size they have.

All types of advanced data types are defined using these primitive data types.

3. int is generally 4 bytes.
Would be different for different compilers.

4 bytes mean having a numbers for -2billion to +2billion.
4 bytes = 4*8 = 32 bits
32nd bit is for sign of integer
31 bits equal 2billion values

unsigned int would mean
all 32 bits being used, and sign is positive
so 4billion values

4. integer types are:-
char -> 1 byte
short -> 2 bytes
int -> 4 bytes
long -> 4 bytes
long long -> 8 bytes

all above can be assigned unsigned

5. char is used for clarity
and for compiler to interpret it as a character value

6. decimals have
float and double

float -> 4 bytes
double -> 8 bytes

7. in c++ all decimal values automatically become double unless specified by a f or F at end


8. bool is true or false
all numbers -> true
zero -> false

bool -> 1 byte
(yes it cant be a bit because computer deals in blocks of bytes)
