1. Uses of std::any:-

a. 

2. std::variant is better
its more type safe as it asks explicitly which types we want

3. variant stores its data in union
any stores its data for small ones like union but large types it stores as void ptr and allocated on the heap (dynamically) (for variables larger than 32 byte)

4. variant also performs faster for bigger allocations as it stores data in union as opposed to on heap for std::any

5. theres a thing called call stack viewable in visual studio

6. std::any is kind of useless btw...lol
it even risks us using dynamic allocations
use variant...lol
