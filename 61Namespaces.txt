1. Classes are a kind of/have their own namespace.
That is why we use :: scope operator when defining its functions in cpp file
Even use :: for inner classes or static and sometimes non static members


2. Use namespaces in scopes, like main scope, function scope or if scope

3. Avoid putting using namespaces in global, as they undo their purpose to avoid naming conflicts

4. If u only use standar lib, you wont get naming conflicts but you will get them once you use c code or maybe some external library
