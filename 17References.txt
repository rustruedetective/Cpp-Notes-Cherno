1. References are like pointers but:-
Assignment of address is done automatically.
Dereferencing is done automatically.
References are not variables so they dont have space in memory like pointers.
They are abstaction of pointers.

2. They are like syntactiall sugar for pointers.
They just need to be initialized with int& or something but the int must touch the &.
They can be assgined a new variable's address directly.
They can modify original variable like they have address to it.

3. A reference must be initialized when declared it cant just be declared alone.
A reference cannot be reassigned.
It cannot be assigned null value as well, since it would just directly go to the null's address.
