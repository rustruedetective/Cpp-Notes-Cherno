1. we can visualize performance with chrome tracing
you can look it up on google...lol

2. go to browser and type this url
chrome://tracing

3. we input our timing data in a json file
then put the json in the chrom tracing thing/app

4. cherno's header file does this making of json file

5. Note:
if u see nested function along with the correct function
turn the timer objects in functions off
to get an empty json
then enable the timer objects to get the real data json
