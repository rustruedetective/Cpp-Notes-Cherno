1. a static analyser will check for errors in code
but its a bit different from compiler errors as it can detect some more logic errors too
e.g so lets say your loop never ends, it would point that out, even tell in detail like the loop check is always positive
e.g a char* not having memory for a null character when copying string to it

2. PVS-Studio is a static analyser tool
pvs can help optimize our code too, e.g if some value is always same, it would point it out
