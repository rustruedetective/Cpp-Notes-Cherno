1. Please note that "" are used to include files relative to current directory.
<> are used to include files relative to include directory defined by compiler.

2. There are two types of guards:-
->
#ifndef CONSTANT
#define CONSTANT

#endif

->
#pragma once

3. Iostream is a header file just like stdlib.h in c.
Only thing is the .h was removed so c and c++ compiler headers could be differentiated.

4. Including libararies in the header's source file is ok, as it degenerates into compiled code.
But dont include it the header file.
