1. union is like a struct or class
but it can only occupy memory of one member at a time

2. memory is set to the biggest data member

3. you can add non static/static functions
but no virtual shinanigans

4. They use them for something like type punning
What if we need a structure like color, where the three members rep color and can be either green or red or blue, but not all at the same time

5. they are usually used namelessly/anonymously
and not with methods
