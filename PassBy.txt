1. Pass by value - simply copies value into new memory address, new memory can be accessed/changed

2. Pass by reference - points to address and value at original memory address can be accessed/changed

3. Pass by reference of two types:-

a. pointers - *ptr: 
i. needs dereferencing to get value at address
ii. can be reassigned to new memory addresses

b. reference - &ref:
i. does not need dereferencing to get value at address
ii. cannot be reassigned to new memory addresses
