1. Memory fragmentation is caused by multi dim arrays which are allocated dynamically.

2. memory fragmentation:
What the heap does is allocate the new int[] arrays in heap
so instead of having them in a continuous memory we have them in seperate spaces in the heap
so they can be close or very far away in memory
causing alot of cache misses

3. So it is very slow to iterate over these
instead of iterating over an array which is made in a row (normal array)

4. So we just need to make sure to place the memory close to each other
which would mean more cache hits and less cache misses
